## First React project created for learning purpose. 
This is a simple approach of building a calculator with ReactJS.

### Available Scripts
The project was created using the command:
##### `npx create-react-app my-app`
Create React App creates a frontend build pipeline, it can be used with any backend. Under the hood, it uses Babel and webpack, but you donâ€™t need to know anything about them.

##### `cd my-app`
Switch to the app.

In the project directory, you can run:
##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if any edits are made.<br />

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
